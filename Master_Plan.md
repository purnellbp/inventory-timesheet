# Development Plan for Inventory and Timesheet Website using React

## Project Setup
- Set up a new React project using Create React App or a similar tool.
- Initialize version control using Git.
- Choose a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

## UI Design and Component Library
- Select a UI component library (e.g., Material-UI or Ant Design) to help build a consistent and responsive design.
- Create wireframes or mockups of your website's layout and key components, including the inventory management and timesheet sections.

## State Management
- Choose a state management library, like Redux or MobX, to manage the application state.
- Set up the state management library, create stores, and define actions and reducers (for Redux) or observable properties and actions (for MobX).

## Data Model and Backend Integration
- Define the data models for inventory items and timesheet entries.
- Choose a backend solution, such as Firebase or a custom REST API, to handle data storage and retrieval.
- Integrate the backend solution with your React app, creating services or hooks to fetch and update data.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement user authentication and authorization using a service like Firebase Authentication or a custom solution.
- Set up protected routes to restrict access to authorized users.

## Inventory Management Features
- Build components for listing, adding, editing, and deleting inventory items.
- Implement search and filtering functionality to help users easily find items.
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large datasets.

## Timesheet Management Features
- Create components for displaying, adding, editing, and deleting timesheet entries.
- Implement date and time manipulation using Moment.js or date-fns.
- Add calendar and time picker components for easier date and time selection.
- Use Formik or React Hook Form for form handling and validation.

## Testing and Debugging
- Set up Jest as the testing framework for your React app.
- Write unit tests for your components and functions using Jest.
- Write integration tests for your application using React Testing Library or a similar library.
- Write end-to-end tests using Cypress or TestCafe to simulate user interactions.
- Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

## Deployment
- Choose a hosting provider, such as Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or Vercel, to deploy your website.
- Set up a continuous deployment pipeline to automatically build and deploy your application when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Maintenance and Updates
- Monitor your application's performance and user feedback.
- Fix bugs, add new features, and update dependencies as needed.

Note: This is a high-level plan, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and preferences.
